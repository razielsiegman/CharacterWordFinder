## Details
----------
In order to streamline the process of specifying individual regulatory conditions for each node in a network, we defined semantics for the .rcspec file type, as follows:
- each line conforms to the syntax `<node name>\t<regulatory condition>\n`
- in the context of building a rules file, each node must have a single regulatory condition defined, whereas in the context of BRE:IN input generation, multiple regulatory conditions can be defined with comma-separated and range syntax (e.g. 1,3,5..17)

## Usage
----------
- Bullets
- Bulltets
    - Subbullets
    ```
    code
